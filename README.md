Random Forest Regression is a machine learning technique that uses the Random Forest algorithm for regression tasks. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate predictions. While Random Forest is often associated with classification problems, it can also be used for regression.

Here's how Random Forest Regression works:

Data Preparation: You start with a dataset containing input features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable) you want to predict.

Random Subsampling: Random Forest creates multiple decision trees by randomly selecting subsets of your training data with replacement. This process is known as bootstrapping. Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data.

Feature Randomization: In addition to random sampling of data points, Random Forest also randomly selects a subset of features for each tree. This helps in reducing the correlation between individual trees, making the ensemble more robust and less prone to overfitting.

Decision Tree Construction: Each tree is grown using a subset of the data and features. Decision trees are constructed to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in the case of regression. They are split based on the feature that provides the best split in terms of reducing MSE.

Ensemble Averaging: Once all the decision trees are trained, predictions are made by averaging the predictions of individual trees in the case of regression. This ensemble averaging helps reduce variance and improve predictive accuracy.

Prediction: To make a prediction for a new input, Random Forest Regression collects predictions from each tree and calculates the final prediction by averaging or taking a weighted average of these predictions.

Key advantages of Random Forest Regression include:

Robustness: Random Forest is less prone to overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
High accuracy: It often provides better predictive performance than other regression methods.
Handles non-linear relationships: Random Forest can capture complex non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.
Feature importance: It can also provide information about feature importance, helping you understand which features are most influential in making predictions.
